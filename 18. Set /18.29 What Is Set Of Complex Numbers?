The set of complex numbers is the collection of all numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, defined by i^2 = âˆ’1. For example, 2 + 3i is a complex number, where 2 is the real part and 3i is the imaginary part.

The set of complex numbers is denoted by C. It is an uncountable set, which means that it has an infinite number of elements and cannot be counted. This is because there is no way to create a one-to-one correspondence between the set of complex numbers and the set of natural numbers.

The set of complex numbers is often used in mathematics and science. For example, it is used to represent the solutions to polynomial equations, the behavior of waves, and the motion of objects in space.

The set of complex numbers is a very rich and interesting mathematical structure. It has many properties that are not shared by other sets of numbers, such as the ability to multiply and divide complex numbers.

Here are some of the important properties of complex numbers:

* Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided.
* The conjugate of a complex number is another complex number that is formed by negating the imaginary part. For example, the conjugate of 2 + 3i is 2 - 3i.
* The absolute value of a complex number is its distance from the origin in the complex plane.
* The argument of a complex number is the angle that the number makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane.
