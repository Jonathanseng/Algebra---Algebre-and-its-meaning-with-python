def f(x):
  """Returns the square of x."""
  return x * x

print(f(3))

# This code defines a function named f that takes an input value, x, and returns the square of x. The function is defined using function notation, and the output value is calculated using the * operator. The code then prints the output value of the function for the input value 3.

#To run this code, you can save it as a file named function_of_x.py and then run it from the command line using the following command:
#python function_of_x.py
# This will print the output value of the function, which is 9.

#Here is an explanation of the code:

#The first line defines the function f. The function takes an input value, x, and returns the square of x.
#The second line defines the output value of the function. The output value is calculated using the * operator.
#The third line prints the output value of the function for the input value 3.
