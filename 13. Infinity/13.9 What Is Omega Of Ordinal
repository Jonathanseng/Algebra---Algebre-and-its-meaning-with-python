In mathematics, an **omega ordinal** is an ordinal number that is greater than all natural numbers. The first omega ordinal is denoted by ω, and the second omega ordinal is denoted by ω + 1, and so on.

Ordinal numbers are a way of measuring the size of infinite sets. The natural numbers are countable, meaning that they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of all natural numbers. The omega ordinals are uncountable, meaning that they cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.

The omega ordinals are named after the Greek letter omega, which is the last letter of the Greek alphabet. The symbol for ω is ω.

The omega ordinals are an important concept in set theory. They are used to study the cardinality of infinite sets and the relationship between different kinds of infinite cardinal numbers.

Here are some additional facts about omega ordinals:

* The omega ordinals are well-ordered, meaning that for any two omega ordinals, there is always a smaller one or a larger one.
* The omega ordinals are limit ordinals, meaning that they are not successor ordinals.
* The omega ordinals are the initial ordinals of the aleph numbers, which are a sequence of infinite cardinal numbers.
