 # This code first defines a function called fourth_root(). This function takes one argument: the number to find the fourth root of. The function then uses the ** operator to calculate the fourth root of the number.

#The code then defines a main function that calls the fourth_root() function with the arguments 256 and 625. This will print the values 4 and 5 to the console.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as fourth_root.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

#This code uses the math module to calculate the square root of the number first, and then raises the result to the power of 0.25. This is equivalent to the first code, but it is a more concise way of writing the code.
