In algebra, a fourth root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself four times, equals the original number. The symbol for the fourth root is 4√. For example, the fourth root of 256 is 4, because 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256.

Fourth roots are used in many different areas of mathematics, including geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. They are also used in many practical applications, such as finding the volume of a regular tetrahedron or the length of a diagonal of a regular tetrahedron.

Here are some of the properties of fourth roots:

* The fourth root of a positive number is always non-negative.
* The fourth root of a negative number is imaginary.
* The fourth root of a perfect fourth power is an integer.
* The fourth root of a non-perfect fourth power is irrational.

Here are some of the uses of fourth roots in algebra:

* Solving equations
* Simplifying expressions
* Calculating volumes and areas
* Studying functions

Here is an example of how to find the fourth root of a number using Python:

```python
def fourth_root(number):
  """
  Calculates the fourth root of a number.

  Args:
    number: The number to find the fourth root of.

  Returns:
    The fourth root of the number.
  """

  import math

  return math.pow(number, 1 / 4)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  print(fourth_root(256))
  # This will print 4

  print(fourth_root(625))
  # This will print 5
```

This code first imports the `math` module, which contains the `pow()` function. The `pow()` function calculates the nth root of a number.

The code then defines a function called `fourth_root()`. This function takes one argument: the number to find the fourth root of. The function then uses the `pow()` function from the `math` module to calculate the fourth root of the number.

The code then defines a main function that calls the `fourth_root()` function with the arguments 256 and 625. This will print the values 4 and 5 to the console.

To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as `fourth_root.py`, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

```
python fourth_root.py
```

This will print the values 4 and 5 to the console.
