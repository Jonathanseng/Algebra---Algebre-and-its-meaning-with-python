The first uncountable ordinal, denoted by ω1 or sometimes by ℵ1, is the smallest ordinal number that, considered as a set, is uncountable. It is the supremum (least upper bound) of all countable ordinals.  

Ordinal numbers are a way of measuring the size of infinite sets. The natural numbers are countable, meaning that they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of all natural numbers. The first uncountable ordinal, ω1, is uncountable, meaning that it cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.

The first uncountable ordinal is an important concept in set theory. It is used to study the cardinality of infinite sets and the relationship between different kinds of infinite cardinal numbers.

Here are some additional facts about the first uncountable ordinal:

* The first uncountable ordinal is greater than all countable ordinals.
* The first uncountable ordinal is the initial ordinal of the aleph numbers, which are a sequence of infinite cardinal numbers.
* The first uncountable ordinal is the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinals.
