The cardinality of the real numbers is â„µ1, which is also known as aleph-one. This means that there are as many real numbers as there are natural numbers, but they cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with each other.

The cardinality of the real numbers was first proved by Georg Cantor in the 19th century. He did this by showing that there is no bijection between the real numbers and the natural numbers. A bijection is a function that maps each element in one set to a unique element in another set. If there were a bijection between the real numbers and the natural numbers, then we could list all the real numbers in a sequence, but this is impossible because there are infinitely many real numbers between any two real numbers.

The cardinality of the real numbers is an important concept in set theory and other areas of mathematics. It is used to study the size of infinite sets and the relationship between different kinds of infinite cardinal numbers.

Here are some additional facts about the cardinality of the real numbers:

* The cardinality of the real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers.
* The cardinality of the real numbers is equal to the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers.
* The cardinality of the real numbers is the smallest cardinality that is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers.
