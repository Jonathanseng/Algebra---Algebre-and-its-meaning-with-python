In algebra, an open interval is a set of real numbers that does not include its endpoints. This means that the interval includes all real numbers between its endpoints, but not the endpoints themselves.

Open intervals are denoted using parentheses, while closed intervals are denoted using square brackets. For example, the open interval (0, 1) includes all real numbers between 0 and 1, but not 0 or 1.

Here are some examples of open intervals:

* (0, 1)
* (-1, 0)
* (2, 3)

Here are some examples of closed intervals:

* [0, 1]
* [-1, 0]
* [2, 3]

Open intervals are often used to represent the domain of a function. For example, the function f(x) = x² is defined for all real numbers in the open interval (-∞, ∞).

Open intervals can also be used to represent the range of a function. For example, the function f(x) = x² has a range of all real numbers greater than or equal to 0.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
