#This code first defines a function called cardinality_of_real_number(). This function returns the cardinality of the real numbers, which is represented by float("inf") in Python.

#The code then defines a function called main(). This function simply prints the cardinality of the real numbers.

#Finally, the code executes the main() function.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as cardinality_of_real_number.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
