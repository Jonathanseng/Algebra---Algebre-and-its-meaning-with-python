In geometry, the base of a triangle is the side that is perpendicular to the height of the triangle. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular distance from the base to the vertex opposite the base.

Any side of a triangle can be the base, but once a base is chosen, the corresponding height is the only possible height for that base.

For example, in the triangle below, side AB is the base, and the height is the perpendicular distance from point C to side AB.

The base of a triangle can be used to calculate the area of the triangle using the following formula:

```
Area = (1/2) * base * height
```

For example, if the base of a triangle is 10 cm and the height is 5 cm, then the area of the triangle is (1/2) * 10 * 5 = 25 cmÂ².
