The set of positive real numbers is the collection of all real numbers that are greater than 0. It is denoted by R+, or sometimes by ℝ+. Some examples of positive real numbers are 1, 2, 3, 1/2, √2, and π.

The set of positive real numbers is an uncountable set, which means that it has an infinite number of elements and cannot be counted. This is because there is no way to create a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive real numbers and the set of natural numbers.

The set of positive real numbers is often used in mathematics and science. For example, it is used to represent the temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius, the speeds above 0 miles per hour, and the lengths above 0 meters.

It is important to note that 0 is not a positive real number. This is because 0 is not greater than 0. Instead, 0 is considered to be a non-negative real number.
