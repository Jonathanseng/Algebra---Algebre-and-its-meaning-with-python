# This code first defines a function called epsilon_ordinal(). This function takes an ordinal number as input and returns the epsilon ordinal with that index. The function uses the float("inf") ** alpha expression to calculate the epsilon ordinal.

#The code then defines a function called main(). This function simply prints the epsilon ordinals with indices 0, 1, and 2.

#Finally, the code executes the main() function.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as epsilon_ordinal.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
