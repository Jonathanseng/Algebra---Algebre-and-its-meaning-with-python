The circumference of a circle is the distance around the edge of the circle. It is the length of the boundary of the circle.

The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = πd, where C is the circumference, π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14, and d is the diameter of the circle.

The diameter of a circle is the length of a straight line that passes through the center of the circle and connects two points on the edge of the circle. It is twice the length of the radius, which is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the edge.

For example, if the diameter of a circle is 10 cm, then the circumference is 31.4 cm.

Here are some other properties of the circumference of a circle:

* The circumference of a circle is always the same, regardless of the size of the circle.
* The circumference of a circle is related to the diameter by the formula C = πd.
* The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.
