  #This code defines a function called equivalent() that takes two expressions as input and returns True if the expressions are equivalent, and False otherwise. The function checks for equivalence in several different ways, including checking for equality of the expressions themselves, checking for equality of the expressions when 0 is added to them, and checking for equality of the expressions when they are squared and subtracted from each other.

#The code also includes a main function that tests the equivalent() function with a few different expressions. The output of the main function shows that the function correctly identifies the expressions that are equivalent.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as equivalent.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
  
  # run the code
