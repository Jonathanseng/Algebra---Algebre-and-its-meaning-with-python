# This code first imports the sympy module from the Python standard library. This module provides a number of functions for working with algebraic numbers, including the root() function.

#The set_algebraic_numbers() function then creates a set of algebraic numbers. The function works by first creating a list of all irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients. Then, it iterates through the list and creates a sympy.root() object for each polynomial. Finally, it adds each sympy.root() object to the set.

#The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to execute the code if the file is being run as a script. In this case, the code will first create a set of algebraic numbers. Then, it will print the set to the console.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_algebraic_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
