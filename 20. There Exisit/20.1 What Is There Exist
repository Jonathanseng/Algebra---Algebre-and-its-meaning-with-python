In algebra, the phrase "there exists" is used to indicate that there is at least one element in a set that satisfies a given condition. For example, the statement "there exists a real number x such that x² ≥ 0" means that there is at least one real number x such that the inequality x² ≥ 0 is true.

The symbol for "there exists" is the existential quantifier, which is often written as ∃. So, the statement "there exists a real number x such that x² ≥ 0" can also be written as ∃x ∈ R : x² ≥ 0, where R is the set of all real numbers.

The phrase "there exists" is a very important concept in algebra, and it is used in many different mathematical statements. For example, the axiom of choice uses the phrase "there exists" to indicate that there is a way to choose one element from each of a collection of non-empty sets.

Here are some examples of how the phrase "there exists" is used in algebra:

* There exists a real number x such that x² ≥ 0.
* There exists an integer n such that n + 1 is greater than or equal to n.
* There exists a set A such that A ⊆ B and A ≠ B.
