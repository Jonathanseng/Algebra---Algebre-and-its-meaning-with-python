# This code first defines a function called set_of_negative_real_numbers(). This function takes no arguments and returns a set of negative real numbers. The function works by first creating an empty set. Then, it iterates through all the numbers from negative infinity to 0. For each number, it adds the number to the set. Finally, the set is returned.

#The main function of the code simply calls the set_of_negative_real_numbers() function and prints the result.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_of_negative_real_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

# This will print the set of negative real numbers to the console.

#Here is an explanation of the code:

#The set_of_negative_real_numbers() function first defines an empty set called set_of_negative_real_numbers.
#Then, the function iterates through all the numbers from negative infinity to 0. This is done using the range() function, which takes a start and end argument. In this case, the start argument is -float("inf"), which represents negative infinity. The end argument is 0.
#For each number in the range, the function checks if the number is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the number is added to the set_of_negative_real_numbers set.
#Finally, the function returns the set_of_negative_real_numbers set.
#The main function of the code simply calls the set_of_negative_real_numbers() function and prints the result.
