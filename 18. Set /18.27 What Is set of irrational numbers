The set of irrational numbers is the collection of all real numbers that are not rational numbers. That is, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Some examples of irrational numbers are π, √2, √3, and Euler's number e.

The set of irrational numbers is an uncountable set, which means that it has an infinite number of elements and cannot be counted. This is because there is no way to create a one-to-one correspondence between the set of irrational numbers and the set of natural numbers.

The set of irrational numbers is often used in mathematics and science. For example, it is used to represent the lengths of certain curves, the areas of certain shapes, and the frequencies of certain sounds.

The set of irrational numbers is denoted by ℚ′, or sometimes by I. It is important to note that 0 is not an irrational number. This is because 0 can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, namely 0/1.

Here is a Python code for a set of irrational numbers:

```python
def set_of_irrational_numbers():
  """Returns a set of irrational numbers."""
  set_of_irrational_numbers = set()
  set_of_irrational_numbers.add(π)
  set_of_irrational_numbers.add(√2)
  set_of_irrational_numbers.add(√3)
  set_of_irrational_numbers.add(e)
  return set_of_irrational_numbers


if __name__ == "__main__":
  set_of_irrational_numbers = set_of_irrational_numbers()
  print(set_of_irrational_numbers)
```

This code first defines a function called `set_of_irrational_numbers()`. This function takes no arguments and returns a set of irrational numbers. The function works by first creating an empty set called `set_of_irrational_numbers`. Then, the function adds the numbers π, √2, √3, and e to the set. Finally, the set is returned.

The main function of the code simply calls the `set_of_irrational_numbers()` function and prints the result.

To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as `set_of_irrational_numbers.py`, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

```
python set_of_irrational_numbers.py
```

This will print the set of irrational numbers to the console.
