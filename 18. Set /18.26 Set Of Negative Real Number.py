# This code first defines a function called set_of_negative_real_numbers(). This function takes no arguments and returns a set of negative real numbers. The function works by first creating an empty set. Then, it iterates through all the numbers from negative infinity to 0. For each number, it adds the number to the set. Finally, the set is returned.

#The main function of the code simply calls the set_of_negative_real_numbers() function and prints the result.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_of_negative_real_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
