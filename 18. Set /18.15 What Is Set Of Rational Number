The set of rational numbers is the set of all numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not equal to zero. In other words, a rational number is any number that can be written in the form of p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not equal to 0.

Some examples of rational numbers are 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 4/5, 5/6, and so on. The number 0 is also a rational number, because it can be written as 0/1.

The set of rational numbers is countable, meaning that it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. This means that there are an infinite number of rational numbers, but there are no more rational numbers than there are natural numbers.

The set of rational numbers is denoted by the symbol ℚ. The set of rational numbers is a subset of the set of real numbers. Real numbers that are not rational are called irrational numbers. Some examples of irrational numbers are √2, π, and e.

The set of rational numbers is an important set in mathematics. It is used in many different mathematical concepts, such as arithmetic, algebra, and calculus. It is also used in many different applications, such as computer science, physics, and engineering.
