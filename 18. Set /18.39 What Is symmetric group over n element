The symmetric group over n elements, denoted by Sn, is the group of all permutations on a set with n elements. A permutation is just a rearrangement of the set. For example, the permutation (1 2 3) rearranges the set {1, 2, 3} to {2, 3, 1}.

The symmetric group Sn has n! elements, where n! is the factorial of n. This is because there are n! ways to rearrange a set with n elements.

The group operation on Sn is composition of permutations. This means that if we have two permutations σ and τ, then their product is the permutation that results from applying σ first and then τ. For example, if σ = (1 2 3) and τ = (2 3), then στ = (1 3 2).

The symmetric group Sn is an important group in mathematics, and it has many applications in different areas, such as combinatorics, Galois theory, and the representation theory of Lie groups.

Here are some examples of symmetric groups:

* The symmetric group S3 is the group of all permutations on a set with 3 elements. It has 3! = 6 elements.
* The symmetric group S4 is the group of all permutations on a set with 4 elements. It has 4! = 24 elements.
* The symmetric group S5 is the group of all permutations on a set with 5 elements. It has 5! = 120 elements.
