An angle in geometry is formed when two rays or lines meet at a common endpoint. The common point of contact is called the vertex of an angle. The word angle comes from a Latin word named 'angulus,' meaning “corner.”

The two rays are called the sides of an angle, and the common endpoint is called the vertex. The angle is measured in degrees or radians, and the measure of an angle is the amount of rotation between the two rays. A full rotation is 360 degrees or 2π radians.

There are many different types of angles, including:

* **Right angles:** These angles measure 90 degrees or π/2 radians.
* **Obtuse angles:** These angles measure more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
* **Acute angles:** These angles measure less than 90 degrees.
* **Straight angles:** These angles measure 180 degrees or π radians.
* **Reflex angles:** These angles measure more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.

Angles are an important part of geometry and are used to construct many different shapes. They are also used in many other areas of mathematics, such as trigonometry and calculus.

Here are some of the applications of angles in geometry:

* **Construction of shapes:** Angles are used to construct many different shapes, such as triangles, squares, and rectangles.
* **Measurement:** Angles can be used to measure distance, length, and area.
* **Problem-solving:** Angles can be used to solve many different types of problems, such as finding the shortest distance between two points or determining if two lines are parallel.
* **Visualization:** Angles can be used to visualize many different concepts, such as motion, direction, and speed.

Here are some examples of angles in the real world:

* The corner of a room
* The intersection of two streets
* The wing of an airplane
* The hands of a clock
* The angle of incidence of light

Angles are an essential part of geometry and mathematics, and they have many applications in the real world.

Here are some additional applications of angles:

* **Computer graphics:** Angles are used to create many different types of images, such as cartoons, maps, and architectural drawings.
* **Engineering:** Angles are used to design and construct many different objects, such as bridges, buildings, and machines.
* **Physics:** Angles are used to model the motion of objects, such as the path of a projectile or the trajectory of a satellite.
* **Navigation:** Angles are used to navigate by land, sea, and air.
