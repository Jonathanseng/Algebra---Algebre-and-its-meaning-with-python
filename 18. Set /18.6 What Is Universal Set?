A universal set is a set that contains all the elements or objects of other sets, including its own elements. It is usually denoted by the symbol 'U'. For example, if we are talking about the set of all even numbers, the universal set would be the set of all natural numbers.

Here are some examples of universal sets:

* The set of all real numbers.
* The set of all integers.
* The set of all natural numbers.
* The set of all letters in the English alphabet.
* The set of all colors.

The universal set is a useful concept in set theory, because it allows us to talk about sets in a more general way. For example, we can say that the set of all even numbers is a subset of the universal set of all natural numbers.

It is important to note that the universal set does not have to be a finite set. For example, the set of all real numbers is an infinite set.
