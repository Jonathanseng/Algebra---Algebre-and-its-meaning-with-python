A set of prime numbers is a set that contains only prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

The set of prime numbers is infinite, and it is one of the most important sets in mathematics. Prime numbers have many applications in mathematics, computer science, and cryptography.

Here are some examples of sets of prime numbers:

* The set of all prime numbers less than 100.
* The set of all prime numbers that are greater than 100 and less than 200.
* The set of all prime numbers that are divisible by 3.
* The set of all prime numbers that are less than the square root of a given number.

The set of prime numbers can be represented in many different ways. One way to represent the set of prime numbers is to use a list. For example, the set of all prime numbers less than 100 can be represented as the list `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...]`.

Another way to represent the set of prime numbers is to use a set. A set is a collection of elements that are unique and cannot be repeated. The set of all prime numbers less than 100 can be represented as the set `{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...}`.

The set of prime numbers is a very important set in mathematics, and it has many applications in different fields.
