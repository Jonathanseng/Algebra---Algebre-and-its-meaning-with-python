# This code first imports the math module from the Python standard library. This module provides a function called pow() that can be used to raise a number to a power.

#The set_p_adic_numbers() function then creates a set of p-adic numbers. The function works by first creating a range of integers from 1 to 10. Then, it iterates through the range and creates a p-adic number for each pair of integers. Finally, it adds each p-adic number to the set.

#The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to execute the code if the file is being run as a script. In this case, the code will first create a set of p-adic numbers for the prime number 2. Then, it will print the set to the console.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_p_adic_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
