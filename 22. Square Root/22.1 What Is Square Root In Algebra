In algebra, a square root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number. The symbol for the square root is √. For example, the square root of 9 is 3, because 3 × 3 = 9.

Square roots are used in many different areas of mathematics, including geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. They are also used in many practical applications, such as finding the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle or the area of a square.

Here are some of the properties of square roots:

* The square root of a positive number is always non-negative.
* The square root of a negative number is imaginary.
* The square root of a perfect square is an integer.
* The square root of a non-perfect square is irrational.

Here are some of the uses of square roots in algebra:

* Solving equations
* Simplifying expressions
* Calculating areas and volumes
* Studying functions
