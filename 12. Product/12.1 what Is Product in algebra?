In algebra, a product is the result of multiplying two or more numbers together. For example, 4 × 7 = 28, so 28 is the product of 4 and 7. The product of two positive numbers is positive, just as the product of two negative numbers is positive as well (e.g., -6 × -4 = 24).

The product of two or more numbers can be written in a variety of ways. For example, 4 × 7 can also be written as 7 × 4, 28, or 4 ⋅ 7. The order in which the numbers are multiplied does not matter, unless the numbers are variables or have different properties (such as commutative or associative).

In algebra, the product of two or more numbers can also be used to represent a variety of other mathematical concepts. For example, the product of two vectors is a vector that represents the direction and magnitude of the resultant of the two vectors. The product of two matrices is a matrix that represents the operation of multiplying the two matrices together.

The product is a fundamental concept in algebra and is used in a variety of mathematical applications. It is important to understand the different ways that the product can be written and used in order to be able to solve mathematical problems that involve multiplication.

Here are some examples of products in algebra:

* The product of 2 and 5 is 10.
* The product of 3 and -4 is -12.
* The product of 2 variables, x and y, is xy.
* The product of two matrices, A and B, is AB.
* The product of two sets, A and B, is A × B.
