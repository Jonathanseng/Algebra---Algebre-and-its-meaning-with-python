The set of negative real numbers is the collection of all real numbers that are less than or equal to 0. It is denoted by R−, or sometimes by ℝ−. Some examples of negative real numbers are -1, -2, -3, -1/2, -√2, and -π.

The set of negative real numbers is an uncountable set, which means that it has an infinite number of elements and cannot be counted. This is because there is no way to create a one-to-one correspondence between the set of negative real numbers and the set of natural numbers.

The set of negative real numbers is often used in mathematics and science. For example, it is used to represent the temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, the speeds below 0 miles per hour, and the lengths below 0 meters.

It is important to note that 0 is not a negative real number. This is because 0 is not less than or equal to 0. Instead, 0 is considered to be a non-negative real number.

Here is a Python code for a set of negative real numbers:

```python
def set_of_negative_real_numbers():
  """Returns a set of negative real numbers."""
  set_of_negative_real_numbers = set()
  for number in range(-float("inf"), 0):
    set_of_negative_real_numbers.add(number)
  return set_of_negative_real_numbers


if __name__ == "__main__":
  set_of_negative_real_numbers = set_of_negative_real_numbers()
  print(set_of_negative_real_numbers)
```

This code first defines a function called `set_of_negative_real_numbers()`. This function takes no arguments and returns a set of negative real numbers. The function works by first creating an empty set. Then, it iterates through all the numbers from negative infinity to 0. For each number, it adds the number to the set. Finally, the set is returned.

The main function of the code simply calls the `set_of_negative_real_numbers()` function and prints the result.

To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as `set_of_negative_real_numbers.py`, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

```
python set_of_negative_real_numbers.py
```

This will print the set of negative real numbers to the console.
