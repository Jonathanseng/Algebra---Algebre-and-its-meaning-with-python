#This code will first create a function called natural_numbers() that takes an integer n as input and returns a set of natural numbers from 1 to n. The function works by looping from 1 to n and adding each integer to the set.

#The code then calls the natural_numbers() function with the argument 10, which means that the function will return a set of the first 10 natural numbers. The code then prints out the set of natural numbers.

#To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as natural_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
