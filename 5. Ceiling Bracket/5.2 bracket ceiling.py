# This code defines a function called ceiling_bracket() that takes a number as input and returns the ceiling bracket of the number. The function uses the math.ceil() function to calculate the ceiling bracket of a number, and then it checks if the number is negative. If the number is negative, the function adds 1 to the ceiling bracket. Otherwise, the function simply returns the ceiling bracket.

#The code also includes a main function that tests the ceiling_bracket() function with a few different numbers. The output of the main function shows that the function correctly returns the ceiling bracket of the numbers.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as ceiling_bracket.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

#This will run the main function and print the output to the console.

#The code can be modified to include other methods for calculating the ceiling bracket of a number. For example, you could use the math.ceil() function to calculate the ceiling bracket of a number.

#The code can also be modified to take a different type of input, such as a string or a list of numbers. For example, you could modify the code to take a string as input and return the ceiling bracket of the first number in the string.
