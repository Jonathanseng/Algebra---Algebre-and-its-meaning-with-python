  #This code defines a function named is_closed_interval that takes an interval as input and returns True if the interval is closed and False otherwise. The function first checks if the interval is a tuple of length 2. If it is not, then the interval is not closed and the function returns False. Otherwise, the function checks if the two elements of the tuple are equal. If they are equal, then the interval is closed and the function returns True. Otherwise, the interval is not closed and the function returns False.

#The code then calls the function is_closed_interval with the interval [0, 1] as input. The function returns False, because the interval [0, 1] is not closed.

#To run this code, you can save it as a file named closed_interval.py and then run it from the command line using the following command:

#This will print the output value of the function, which is False.
