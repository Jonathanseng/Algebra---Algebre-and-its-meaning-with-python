  # This code first imports the math module, which contains the definition of Euler's constant. Then, it defines a function called euler_constant() that prints the value of Euler's constant. The function uses the math.gamma constant to get the value of Euler's constant.

#The if __name__ == "__main__": block at the end of the code is used to execute the code if it is being run as a script. If the code is being imported into another program, this block will not be executed.

#The code then prints the value of Euler's constant.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as euler_constant.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
