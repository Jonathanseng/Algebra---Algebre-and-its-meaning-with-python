The set of real numbers is the set of all numbers that can be represented as a decimal number, either finite or infinite. This includes all integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers.

The set of real numbers is denoted by the symbol R. The set R is an uncountable set, meaning that there are an infinite number of real numbers, and there is no way to put them into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.

The set of real numbers is a rich and complex mathematical structure. It has many interesting properties, and it is used in many different areas of mathematics, such as calculus, analysis, and geometry.

Here are some examples of real numbers:

* Integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
* Rational numbers: 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, ...
* Irrational numbers: √2, π, e, ...

The set of real numbers is a subset of the set of complex numbers. Complex numbers are numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit. The set of complex numbers is denoted by the symbol C.

The set of real numbers is an important set in mathematics. It is used in many different mathematical concepts, such as arithmetic, algebra, and calculus. It is also used in many different applications, such as computer science, physics, and engineering.
