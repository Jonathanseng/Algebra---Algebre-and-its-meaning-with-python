  #This code defines a function called proportional() that takes two numbers as input and returns True if x is proportional to y, and False otherwise. The function checks for proportionality by dividing x by y and comparing the result to a constant value.

#The code also includes a main function that tests the proportional() function with a few different values. The output of the main function shows that the function correctly identifies the values that are proportional.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as proportional.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

# This will run the main function and print the output to the console.

#The code can be modified to include other methods for checking proportionality. For example, you could add a check for proportionality using the properties of mathematical operations.

#The constant value in the code is arbitrary. You can change it to any value you want. For example, if you want to check for proportionality with a constant of 3, you would change the code to the following:

def proportional(x, y):
  """Returns True if x is proportional to y, False otherwise."""

  if y == 0:
    return False

  return x / y == 3
