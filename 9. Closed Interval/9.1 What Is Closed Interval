In algebra, a closed interval is a set of real numbers that includes its endpoints. This means that the interval includes all real numbers between its endpoints, as well as the endpoints themselves.

Closed intervals are denoted using square brackets, while open intervals are denoted using parentheses. For example, the closed interval [0, 1] includes all real numbers between 0 and 1, including 0 and 1.

Here are some examples of closed intervals:

* [0, 1]
* [-1, 0]
* [2, 3]

Here are some examples of open intervals:

* (0, 1)
* (-1, 0)
* (2, 3)

Closed intervals are often used to represent the domain of a function. For example, the function f(x) = x² is defined for all real numbers in the closed interval [-∞, ∞].

Closed intervals can also be used to represent the range of a function. For example, the function f(x) = x² has a range of all real numbers greater than or equal to 0.
