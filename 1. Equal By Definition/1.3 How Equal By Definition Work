Equal by definition in algebra works by using the definitions of mathematical terms to show that two expressions are equal. For example, the definition of 0 to the 0th power is 1, so the expressions `0^0` and `1` are equal by definition.

Here are some other examples of how equal by definition works in algebra:

* The expression `x + 0 = x` is equal by definition because the definition of 0 is the additive identity, which means that it adds nothing to any number.
* The expression `a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)` is equal by definition because it is the difference of squares factorization.
* The expression `sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1` is equal by definition because it is the Pythagorean identity.

In general, equal by definition works by using the definitions of mathematical terms to show that two expressions are equal. This can be a useful tool for simplifying algebraic expressions and for proving mathematical theorems.

Here are some tips for using equal by definition in algebra:

* Be familiar with the definitions of mathematical terms.
* Look for patterns in expressions that might suggest that they are equal by definition.
* Use the properties of mathematical operations to simplify expressions before comparing them.
* If you are unsure whether two expressions are equal by definition, you can always consult a reference book or ask a math teacher or tutor.
