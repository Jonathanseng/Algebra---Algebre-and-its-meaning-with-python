# This code first defines a function called multiplicative_identity(). The function takes one number as input, and it returns the product of that number and 1. The if __name__ == "__main__": block at the end of the code is used to run the function when the code is executed as a script. The code then prints the result of calling the multiplicative_identity() function with the number 5 as input.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run the file from the command line. For example, if you save the code as identity.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
