# This code first defines a function called set_of_quaternions(). This function takes no arguments and returns a set of quaternions. The function works by first creating an empty set called set_of_quaternions. Then, the function iterates over all the real parts from -10 to 10 and all the imaginary parts from -10 to 10. For each real and imaginary part, the function creates a quaternion and adds it to the set. Finally, the set is returned.

#The main function of the code simply calls the set_of_quaternions() function and prints the result.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_of_quaternions.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
