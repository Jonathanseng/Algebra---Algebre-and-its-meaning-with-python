In mathematics, the **set of natural numbers** is a set of numbers that are used for counting and are a part of real numbers. The set of natural numbers includes only the positive integers, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ………. ∞.

The set of natural numbers is often denoted by the letter *N*.

The set of natural numbers is countable, which means that it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of integers. This means that there are an infinite number of natural numbers, but they can be counted.

The set of natural numbers is also well-ordered, which means that any two natural numbers can be compared. This means that there is a smallest natural number, 1, and for any natural number n, there is a natural number n + 1 that is greater than n.

The set of natural numbers is an important set in mathematics, and it is used in many different areas of mathematics, such as arithmetic, algebra, and calculus.

Here are some examples of natural numbers:

* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 5
* 6
* 7
* 8
* 9
* 10

Here are some examples of numbers that are not natural numbers:

* 0
* -1
* -2
* -3
* -4
* -5
* -6
* -7
* -8
* -9
