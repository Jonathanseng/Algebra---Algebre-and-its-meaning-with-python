The golden ratio in algebra is the irrational number (1 +√5)/2, which is approximately equal to 1.618. It is often denoted by the Greek letter ϕ or τ. The golden ratio can be calculated using the following formula:

```
ϕ = (1 + √5)/2
```

The golden ratio can also be expressed as the limit of the ratios of successive terms in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first few terms in the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

The golden ratio has been found to have many applications in mathematics, art, architecture, and nature. In mathematics, the golden ratio is used in the study of spirals, phyllotaxis, and the Fibonacci sequence. In art, the golden ratio is used to create aesthetically pleasing designs. In architecture, the golden ratio is used to create buildings that are both functional and beautiful. In nature, the golden ratio can be found in the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the spiral patterns of seashells, and the proportions of the human body.

Here are some examples of how the golden ratio is used in algebra:

* The golden ratio can be used to calculate the golden spiral, which is a spiral that is often found in nature.
* The golden ratio can be used to create aesthetically pleasing rectangles, known as golden rectangles.
* The golden ratio can be used to create golden triangles, which are triangles that have a ratio of 1:1.618 between their sides.

The golden ratio is a fascinating number with many interesting properties. It has been found to have applications in many different fields, and it continues to be studied by mathematicians and scientists today.
