In algebra, a cube root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals the original number. The symbol for the cube root is ∛. For example, the cube root of 27 is 3, because 3 × 3 × 3 = 27.

Cube roots are used in many different areas of mathematics, including geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. They are also used in many practical applications, such as finding the volume of a cube or the length of a diagonal of a cube.

Here are some of the properties of cube roots:

* The cube root of a positive number is always non-negative.
* The cube root of a negative number is imaginary.
* The cube root of a perfect cube is an integer.
* The cube root of a non-perfect cube is irrational.

Here are some of the uses of cube roots in algebra:

* Solving equations
* Simplifying expressions
* Calculating volumes and areas
* Studying functions

Here is an example of how to find the cube root of a number using Python:

```python
def cube_root(number):
  """
  Calculates the cube root of a number.

  Args:
    number: The number to find the cube root of.

  Returns:
    The cube root of the number.
  """

  import math

  return math.cbrt(number)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  print(cube_root(27))
  # This will print 3

  print(cube_root(64))
  # This will print 4
```

This code first imports the `math` module, which contains the `cbrt()` function. The `cbrt()` function calculates the cube root of a number.

The code then defines a function called `cube_root()`. This function takes one argument: the number to find the cube root of. The function then uses the `cbrt()` function from the `math` module to calculate the cube root of the number.

The code then defines a main function that calls the `cube_root()` function with the arguments 27 and 64. This will print the values 3 and 4 to the console.

To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as `cube_root.py`, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

```
python cube_root.py
```

This will print the values 3 and 4 to the console.
