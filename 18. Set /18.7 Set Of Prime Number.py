#This code first defines a function called is_prime(). This function takes a number as an argument and returns True if the number is prime and False otherwise. The function works by checking if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number.

#The next function is called generate_primes(). This function takes a number as an argument and returns a set of prime numbers less than or equal to the number. The function works by calling the is_prime() function on all numbers from 2 to the number and adding the prime numbers to a set.

#The last function is called main(). This function prints the set of prime numbers less than or equal to 100. The set of prime numbers is printed by calling the print() function on the output of the generate_primes() function.

#The last line of code specifies that the main() function is the entry point for the program. This means that when the program is run, the main() function will be executed first.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as prime_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

#This will print the set of prime numbers less than or equal to 100 to the console.

#The output of the code will be a set of the prime numbers from 2 to 100. This is because the generate_primes() function in Python returns a set of all the prime numbers from 2 to the number that is passed as an argument.

#I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
