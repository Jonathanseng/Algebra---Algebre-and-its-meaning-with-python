The set of quaternions is the collection of all numbers of the form a + bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers and i, j, and k are the quaternion units, defined by i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1 and ij = k = -ji, jk = i = -kj, and ki = j = -ik. For example, 1 + 2i + 3j + 4k is a quaternion, where 1 is the real part and 2i, 3j, and 4k are the imaginary parts.

The set of quaternions is denoted by H. It is an extension of the set of complex numbers, and it can be used to represent rotations in three dimensions.

Here are some of the important properties of quaternions:

* Quaternions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided.
* The conjugate of a quaternion is another quaternion that is formed by negating the imaginary parts. For example, the conjugate of 1 + 2i + 3j + 4k is 1 - 2i - 3j - 4k.
* The absolute value of a quaternion is its distance from the origin in the quaternionic plane.
* The argument of a quaternion is the angle that the number makes with the positive real axis in the quaternionic plane.

The set of quaternions is a very rich and interesting mathematical structure. It has many applications in physics, engineering, and computer science.
