In mathematics, particularly in set theory, the **aleph numbers** are a sequence of numbers used to represent the cardinality (or size) of infinite sets that can be well-ordered. The first aleph number, **aleph-null** (ℵ0), is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. It is followed by aleph-one (ℵ1), aleph-two (ℵ2), and so on.

The aleph numbers are transfinite numbers, meaning that they are greater than any finite number. They are also cardinal numbers, meaning that they represent the size of sets.

The aleph numbers are named after the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, aleph. The symbol for aleph-null is ℵ0, and the symbol for aleph-one is ℵ1.

The aleph numbers are important in set theory because they allow us to talk about the size of infinite sets. For example, we can say that the set of real numbers has a greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers, because the cardinality of the set of real numbers is ℵ1, while the cardinality of the set of natural numbers is ℵ0.

The aleph numbers are also important in other areas of mathematics, such as combinatorics and measure theory.

Here are some additional facts about aleph numbers:

* The aleph numbers are well-ordered, meaning that for any two aleph numbers, there is always a smaller one or a larger one.
* The aleph numbers are uncountable, meaning that they cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
* The aleph numbers are ordinal numbers, meaning that they can be compared to each other.
