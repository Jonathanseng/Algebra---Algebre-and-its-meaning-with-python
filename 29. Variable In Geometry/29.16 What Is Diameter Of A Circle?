The diameter of a circle is the length of a line segment that passes through the center of the circle and connects two points on the circle's edge. It is the longest chord of a circle. The diameter is twice the length of the radius, which is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the edge. The formula for the diameter of a circle is D = 2r, where D is the diameter and r is the radius.

For example, if the radius of a circle is 5 cm, then the diameter is 10 cm.

Here are some other properties of the diameter of a circle:

* The diameter is the same length regardless of which two points on the circle's edge it passes through.
* The diameter bisects the circle, meaning that it divides the circle into two equal halves.
* The diameter is perpendicular to the radius at the point where it intersects the circle.
* The diameter is related to the circumference of the circle by the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.
