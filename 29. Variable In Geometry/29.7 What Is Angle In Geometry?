In geometry, an angle is formed when two rays or lines meet at a common endpoint. The common point of contact is called the vertex of an angle. The word angle comes from a Latin word named 'angulus,' meaning “corner.”

The two rays are called the sides of an angle, and the common endpoint is called the vertex. The angle is measured in degrees or radians, and the measure of an angle is the amount of rotation between the two rays. A full rotation is 360 degrees or 2π radians.

There are many different types of angles, including:

* **Right angles:** These angles measure 90 degrees or π/2 radians.
* **Obtuse angles:** These angles measure more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
* **Acute angles:** These angles measure less than 90 degrees.
* **Straight angles:** These angles measure 180 degrees or π radians.
* **Reflex angles:** These angles measure more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.

Angles are an important part of geometry and are used to construct many different shapes. They are also used in many other areas of mathematics, such as trigonometry and calculus.

Here are some examples of angles in the real world:

* The corner of a room
* The intersection of two streets
* The wing of an airplane
* The hands of a clock
* The angle of incidence of light
