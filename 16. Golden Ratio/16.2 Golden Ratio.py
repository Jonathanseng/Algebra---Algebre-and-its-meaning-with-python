  # This code first imports the math module, which contains the sqrt() function. Then, it defines a function called golden_ratio(), which calculates the golden ratio using the formula (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2. Finally, it defines a main function that prints the golden ratio.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as golden_ratio.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
