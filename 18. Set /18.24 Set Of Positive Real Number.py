# This code first defines a function called set_of_positive_real_numbers(). This function takes no arguments and returns a set of positive real numbers. The function works by first creating an empty set. Then, it iterates through all the numbers from 1 to infinity. For each number, it checks if the number is greater than 0. If it is, the number is added to the set. Finally, the set is returned.

#The main function of the code simply calls the set_of_positive_real_numbers() function and prints the result.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_of_positive_real_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
