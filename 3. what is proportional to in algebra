In algebra, two quantities are said to be **proportional** if their ratio is constant. This means that if we divide one quantity by the other, we will always get the same number. For example, the quantities `x` and `2x` are proportional, because their ratio is always 2.

The symbol for proportionality is the Greek letter ∝, which is pronounced "alpha". We can write `x ∝ 2x` to mean that `x` is proportional to `2x`.

Proportionality can be used to represent a variety of relationships in algebra. For example, we can use proportionality to represent the relationship between the speed of an object and the distance it travels. If we let `s` represent the speed of the object and `d` represent the distance it travels, then we can write `s ∝ d` to mean that the speed is proportional to the distance.

Proportionality can also be used to solve problems in algebra. For example, if we know that the speed of an object is proportional to the distance it travels, and we know the distance the object travels, we can use proportionality to solve for the speed of the object.

Here are some other examples of proportionality in algebra:

* The area of a square is proportional to the square of its side length.
* The volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius.
* The force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Proportionality is a powerful tool that can be used to represent and solve a variety of problems in algebra. By understanding the concept of proportionality, you can use it to solve a variety of problems in physics, chemistry, and other areas of science.
