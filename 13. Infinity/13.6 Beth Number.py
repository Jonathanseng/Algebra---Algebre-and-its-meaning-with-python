# This code first defines a function called beth_number(). This function takes an ordinal number as input and returns the beth number for that number. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns float("inf") ** alpha, which represents infinity in Python raised to the power of alpha.

#The code then defines a function called main(). This function simply prints the beth numbers for the ordinal numbers 0, 1, and 2.

#Finally, the code executes the main() function.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as beth_number.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
