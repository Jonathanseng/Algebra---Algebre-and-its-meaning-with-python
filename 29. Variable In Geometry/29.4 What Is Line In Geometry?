In geometry, a line is a one-dimensional figure that has length but no width. It is a set of points that extends infinitely in both directions. A line can be defined as a set of collinear points, which means that all of the points on the line lie on a straight path.

There are different types of lines, including:

* **Straight lines:** These lines have no curves and extend infinitely in both directions.
* **Curved lines:** These lines have curves and do not extend infinitely in both directions.
* **Oblique lines:** These lines are diagonal or slanting, but they are not perpendicular, parallel, or vertical.
* **Horizontal lines:** These lines run from left to right.
* **Vertical lines:** These lines run from top to bottom.
* **Parallel lines:** These lines never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.
* **Perpendicular lines:** These lines intersect at a right angle (90 degrees).

Lines are an important part of geometry and are used to construct many different shapes. They are also used in many other areas of mathematics, such as algebra and calculus.

Here are some examples of lines in the real world:

* The horizon
* The edge of a piece of paper
* The path of a moving car
* The border between two countries
* The equator
