// This algorithm takes two expressions as input and returns True if the expressions are equal by definition, and False otherwise. The algorithm checks for equality in several different ways, including checking for equality of the expressions themselves, checking for equality of the expressions when 0 is added to them, and checking for equality of the expressions when they are squared and subtracted from each other.

//The algorithm works by using the definitions of mathematical terms to show that two expressions are equal. For example, the definition of 0 to the 0th power is 1, so the expressions 0^0 and 1 are equal by definition.

//The algorithm is implemented in Python, but it can be easily translated into other programming languages.
