In mathematics, the multiplicative identity is the number that, when multiplied by any other number, leaves the other number unchanged. For example, 1 is the multiplicative identity for the natural numbers, because multiplying 1 by any natural number results in that same number.

In other words, the multiplicative identity of a number is the number that, when multiplied by that number, gives the original number.

The multiplicative identity of 1 is itself, 1. This is because multiplying 1 by any number, including 1, results in the original number. For example,

```
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 1 = 2
5 x 1 = 5
```

As you can see, no matter what number we multiply by 1, the result is always the original number. This is why 1 is called the multiplicative identity of 1.

The multiplicative identity is also called the unit element. It is an important property of multiplication, and it is used in many different mathematical applications. For example, the multiplicative identity is used to simplify algebraic expressions, to solve equations, and to calculate probabilities.
