#This code will first create a function called set_of_integers() that takes a list of integers as input and returns a set of integers. The function works by looping through the list of integers and adding each integer to the set.

#The code then calls the set_of_integers() function with the list of integers numbers, which means that the function will return a set of the integers in the list. The code then prints out the set of integers.

#To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_of_integers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
