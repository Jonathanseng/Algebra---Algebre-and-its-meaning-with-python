# This code first defines a function called is_irrational() that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is irrational and False otherwise. The function works by checking if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these integers, then it is rational and the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True.

#The code then defines a set called irrational_numbers that contains all the irrational numbers from 1 to 1000. The set is populated by using a for loop that iterates over all the numbers from 1 to 1000 and calls the is_irrational() function on each number. If the function returns True, then the number is added to the set.

#Finally, the code prints the set irrational_numbers.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as irrational_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
