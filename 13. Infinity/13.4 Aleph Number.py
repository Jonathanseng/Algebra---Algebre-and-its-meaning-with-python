# This code first defines a function called aleph_number(). This function takes a natural number as input and returns the aleph number for that number. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns float("inf"), which represents infinity in Python.

#The code then defines a function called main(). This function simply prints the aleph numbers for the natural numbers 0, 1, and 2.

#Finally, the code executes the main() function.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as aleph_number.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
