# This code first defines a function called omega_ordinal(). This function returns the omega ordinal, which is represented by float("inf") in Python.

#The code then defines a function called main(). This function simply prints the omega ordinal.

#Finally, the code executes the main() function.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as omega_ordinal.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

# As you can see, the code correctly prints the omega ordinal.

#Please note that this code is just a simple example. There are more sophisticated ways to implement the omega ordinal in Python.

#Here is another way to implement the omega ordinal in Python:

#This code defines a class called OmegaOrdinal. This class represents the omega ordinal. The class has a single attribute called value, which is the value of the omega ordinal. The class also has a method called __str__, which returns a string representation of the omega ordinal.

#The omega_ordinal() function returns an instance of the OmegaOrdinal class.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as omega_ordinal_class.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
