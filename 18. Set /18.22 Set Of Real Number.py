# This code first defines a function called set_real_numbers(). The function takes no arguments and returns a set of real numbers.

#The function works by first creating a range of integers from -100 to 100. Then, it iterates through the range and converts each integer to a floating-point number. Finally, it adds each floating-point number to the set.

#The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to execute the code if the file is being run as a script. In this case, the code will first create a set of real numbers. Then, it will print the set to the console.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as set_real_numbers.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
